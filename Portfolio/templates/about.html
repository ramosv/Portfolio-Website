  <div class="card text-center" style="width: 80rem;margin:0 auto;">
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">Hello and welcome to my website. I appracite the time you are taking to learn 
    more about me and my work. Having this website makes it really easy for me to share my experience with others. This allows me to share this website with other people who would like to know more about my more.
On this page I would also like to tell you a small introduction about myself. My name is Vicente Ramos and I will be graduating from the University of Northern Colorado(UNC) May 2021. 
I graduated from Aims in 2018 with a Business Administration degree and I wanted to continue my education which is why decided to come to UNC. 
Prior to coming to here I didn't know which area of business I wanted to get into. 
But after doing some research I decided to settle for Computer Information Sytems because it looked like a well rounded degree that offers flexibility upon graduation. 
After my first year at UNC I decided to pick u minor in computer science to learn more about programing. That is kind of how I landed here today 
building a website to showcase some of my computer science projects. My business classes thought me a lot of useful and applicable material but my favorite courses were the CS couses no doubt. </h5>
